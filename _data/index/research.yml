    Crowd behaviour analysis is an emerging research area. Due to its
    novelty, a proper taxonomy to organise its different sub-tasks is
    still missing. This paper proposes a taxonomic organisation of
    existing works following a pipeline, where sub-problems in last
    stages benefit from the results in previous ones. Models that
    employ Deep Learning to solve crowd anomaly detection, one of the
    proposed stages, are reviewed in depth, and the few works that
    address emotional aspects of crowds are outlined. The importance
    of bringing emotional aspects into the study of crowd behaviour is
    remarked, together with the necessity of producing real-world,
    challenging datasets in order to improve the current
    solutions. Opportunities for fusing these models into already
    functioning video analytics systems are proposed.

    The problem of Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) consists in
    following the trajectory of different objects in a sequence,
    usually a video. In recent years, with the rise of Deep Learning,
    the algorithms that provide a solution to this problem have
    benefited from the representational power of deep models. This
    paper provides a comprehensive survey on works that employ Deep
    Learning models to solve the task of MOT on single-camera
    videos. Four main steps in MOT algorithms are identified, and an
    in-depth review of how Deep Learning was employed in each one of
    these stages is presented. A complete experimental comparison of
    the presented works on the three MOTChallenge datasets is also
    provided, identifying a number of similarities among the
    top-performing methods and presenting some possible future
    research directions.

    The quality of the data is directly related to the quality of the
    models drawn from that data. For that reason, many research is
    devoted to improve the quality of the data and to amend errors
    that it may contain. One of the most common problems is the
    presence of noise in classification tasks, where noise refers to
    the incorrect labeling of training instances. This problem is very
    disruptive, as it changes the decision boundaries of the
    problem. Big Data problems pose a new challenge in terms of
    quality data due to the massive and unsupervised accumulation of
    data. This Big Data scenario also brings new problems to classic
    data preprocessing algorithms, as they are not prepared for
    working with such amounts of data, and these algorithms are key to
    move from Big to Smart Data. In this paper, an iterative ensemble
    filter for removing noisy instances in Big Data scenarios is
    proposed. Experiments carried out in six Big Data datasets have
    shown that our noise filter outperforms the current
    state‐of‐the‐art noise filter in Big Data domains. It has also
    proved to be an effective solution for transforming raw Big Data
    into Smart Data.
